each containing a Lesson Number, Lesson Date, Link and Passcode.

Once the parsing is finished, the user will be presented with a menu that allows

Choosing to download a specific clip, the user will be presented with the table of available clips,
mentioning the lesson numbers and dates. Choosing the clip by lesson number and pressing ENTER will start the download.
